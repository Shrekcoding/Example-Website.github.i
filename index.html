            <p>My name is Aron Singel, and I am intrigued to meet all of you!</p>
            <p>Some things to note about me is that I am an Eagle Scout as well as a first degree black belt in Tae Kwon Doe.</p>
            <p> My hobbies include gaming of all sorts whether it be digital or tabletop.</p>
            <p>My favorite tv show as of late is Titans, a live action adaptation of the origional Teen Titans from the DC universe.</p>
            <p>You may notice that I am behind some mountains wearing nothing but a T-shirt and my skin looks unnaturally smooth. This is because I photoshopped an image of me sitting down near my computer and cut myself out of that background and pasted myself to this one. As for the skin, I did a mixture of reverse layering in addition to high pass filters and a gauss blur.</p>

            <p>Sierra is a ridgeback, and Sequoia is a chocolate lab; both dogs were named after the Sequoia forrest in California.</p>
